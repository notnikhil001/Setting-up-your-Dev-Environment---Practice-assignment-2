# Dev Environment Setup

## Overview
This project is part of the Kalvium Practice Assignment #2, where we set up a development environment for a Node.js project. It includes setting up Git, installing necessary npm packages, and pushing the code to GitHub.

## Features
- Initializes a Node.js project with `npm init -y`
- Installs essential dependencies (`express`, `dotenv`, `mongoose`)
- Uses `nodemon` for automatic restarts during development
- Configures Git for version control
- Sets up a simple Express server

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Git installed
- A GitHub account

### Steps to Set Up
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd dev-environment-setup
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to verify the setup.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-branch`
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Added new feature"`
4. Push the changes: `git push origin feature-branch`
5. Open a pull request.
